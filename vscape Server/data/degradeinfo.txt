@dbl@-In general-
Degradation is hit based, with the following rules:

-2500 hits per degrade stage.
-10gp/hit for Barrows, 50gp/hit for Crystal.

That gives Barrows items 10k total hits, and
Crystal equipment 25k total hits / shots.

@dbl@-Hit based?-
Each time you strike an Npc, a hit is applied
to your weapon (provided it is Barrows/Crystal).

However, each time you recieve a hit, the hit is
applied randomly to a piece of degradeable worn.
If you are wearing a full set of Barrows, then
only the helm or body or legs will take a hit each
time you take a hit. This can be extended further
using the Crystal shield.

@dbl@-Where to repair?-
Barrows can be repaired by Bob in Lumbridge, or
the Squire located on Pest Control Island.

Crystal equipment can be repaired by Ilfeen, just
outside the west gate of the Elf city, by the
Crystal vendor. She is also known to visit Pest
Control Island.
